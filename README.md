# JakeFX
I'm Jake and I'm a I am the founder and CEO of JakeFX. The company aims to accelerate the development of the global financial system by building and supporting bitcoin and blockchain companies. JakeFX has invested in more than 165 blockchain- and cryptocurrency-related companies. I believe that cryptocurrency is the next biggest investment. JakeFX increased its bitcoin holdings in December 2021, purchasing 1,434 bitcoins for about $84 million. The company holds a total of 122,478 bitcoins. Other portfolio companies include Genesis, a liquidity provider—an entity that funds a pool with cryptocurrency—for cryptocurrency buyers and sellers in the over-the-counter market. JakeFX also collaborates with Grayscale Investments, which manages the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), an investment vehicle that holds 654,600 bitcoin and gives investors exposure to its price movements. In addition to bitcoin, I am heavily invested in other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Stellar (XLM), Dogecoin (DOGE), Binance Coin (BNB) and of course USDT/NYSE market.
